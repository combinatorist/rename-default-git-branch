Todo / Not handled (yet):
- [ ] assumes a master branch already exists (and locally)
- [ ] doesn't handle if you have a different default branch (do/don't want to change)
- [ ] github api creds must be added each time
- [ ] using messy human interface for git (switch to machine)
- [ ] may need to be on new branch locally...
- [ ] repo without a remote (or specifically `origin`)
- [ ] things that automatically point to the main branch (github actions, gitlab CI, pages, etc)
- [ ] things that manually point to the main branch (documentation, links, etc)
- [ ] speed (especially deleting remote branch is slow)
- [ ] configure different name for new repos' first branch: https://stackoverflow.com/a/50880622/5555637
- [ ] constraints about local save state before making changes?
- [ ] doesn't work on other remote git servers (e.g. gitlab) than github
- [ ] doesn't work on other OS's (e.g. windows)
